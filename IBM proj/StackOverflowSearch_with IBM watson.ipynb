For that, I started practicing first in my localhost creating a node js server to serves the static app. I made it following this article (https://medium.com/netscape/deploying-a-vue-js-2-x-app-to-heroku-in-5-steps-tutorial-a69845ace489). Basically says that I have to create a &#39;server.js&#39; file in the root of the app (containing the basic code to serve it at port 5000), then add a new script &#39;start&#39; in the package.json that runs the &#39;node server.js&#39; command.
